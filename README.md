Resource Management Dashboard – Power BI

This interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to monitor and manage project resources, track progress, and visualize team workload efficiently. The solution provides both an organisation-wide summary and project-level insights for data-driven decision-making.

* Key Features:

Executive Overview: Displays total projects, project status (on-track, delayed, in-pipeline) and total active resources.

Resource Summary: Highlights team composition across roles such as Project Managers, Business Analysts, Developers, QA Engineers and UI/UX Designers.

Activity Tracking: Monitors key metrics including QA and development progress, new/reopened bugs, and tasks on hold.

Complexity Analysis: Visualizes project distribution by complexity (Low, Medium, High) to support workload balancing.

Resource Utilization: Provides an overview of working vs idle resources with clear percentage indicators.

Hierarchical View (Project-Level): Shows resource structure per project, mapping PM → BA → UI/UX → QA → Dev flow.

Task Distribution: Illustrates task allocation by role using dynamic charts to identify capacity and performance trends.

* Tools & Technologies:

Microsoft Power BI

Data Modeling (Power Query, DAX)

Interactive Visuals & Drill-Through Reports

Excel/SharePoint as data sources

* Outcome:
Enabled management to gain real-time visibility into project health, resource allocation and productivity levels—supporting proactive decision-making and efficient project execution.
